# Summary

Gensplore is a software tool designed for exploring microbial genomes, specifically displaying genbank files in a user-friendly manner. This tool allows for scrolling in the vertical dimension, zooming in and out, and labeling of codons with indices. Gensplore enables users to easily visualize the genes and coding regions of a microbial genome, facilitating analysis and interpretation of genetic information. Overall, Gensplore is a valuable tool for researchers and scientists who are interested in exploring and understanding microbial genomes.

# Statement of need

Microbial genomics research has grown significantly in recent years, driven by the increasing availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies and the recognition of the critical role of microbes in various biological processes. As a result, there is a growing need for user-friendly tools to aid researchers in exploring and analyzing microbial genomes. While genbank files provide a wealth of genetic information, their display can be challenging, making it difficult to visualize and interpret the underlying genetic data.

To address this challenge, Gensplore was developed as a tool for exploring microbial genomes, enabling researchers to easily navigate and interpret genbank files. Gensplore provides a flexible and intuitive interface that enables users to scroll, zoom in and out, and label codons with indices, allowing for a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of microbial genetic information.

# Implementation

Gensplore is implemented as a React component, which provides a modular and flexible design for easy integration into various software applications. The component uses virtual scrolling to optimize performance by rendering only the area that is currently being viewed by the user, which significantly reduces the memory usage and enhances the overall performance of the tool. This approach makes Gensplore highly efficient, even for very large genbank files.

In addition, Gensplore is designed to be reusable by others, packaged as an independent component that can be integrated into other software projects with ease. This enhances the flexibility of the tool, allowing researchers to use it in various contexts and software environments.

Overall, the implementation of Gensplore as a React component with virtual scrolling technology and packaging for reuse by others represents a powerful and adaptable solution to the challenge of exploring microbial genomes. It provides a simple, efficient, and effective way to navigate genbank files, helping researchers to better understand microbial genetic data and advance their research in this important field.
